        Represents a database-derived entity, such as a table, view, or query result. Entities may have tags to help entity_configs that may be interested in them. The relationships between db_entities and entity_configs are registered by the DbEntityInterest class, which also defines the type of interest. Some db_entities are "owned" by one entity_config, while others might simply have an "observe" or "edit" or "dependency" relationship. These roles will be figured out later. The key indicates a specific function of the db_entity, such as "base" to indicate a table used for base data. Tags are broader descriptors, such as "university", used for categorization or queries. DbEntities use the SharedKey mixin to permit multiple DbEntities in the same context (e.g. those of a particular ConfigEntity interest) to share a key. This permits the user to assign multiple tables of the same key (e.g. 'base') to a ConfigEntity instance. The ConfigEntity instance tracks which DbEntity is the default in this situation (see ConfigEntity.selections['db_entities'] and defaults if only one DbEntity with a particular key is present)
