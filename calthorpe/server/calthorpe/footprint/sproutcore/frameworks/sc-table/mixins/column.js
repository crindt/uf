  that will be used as a column in the TableView's 'columns' property.
*/

SCTable.Column = {

  // PUBLIC PROPERTIES
  
  isColumn: YES,
  
  /*
    The name of the column -- will be shown in this column's header view.
  */
  name: null,

  /*
    The name of the property on your row objects whose value should be
    shown in this column.
  */
  valueKey: null,

  /*
    @optional
    The name of the property on your row objects whose value will provide an
    icon classname string for this column.  If null, will be ignored and no icon class
    will be added.
    
    If this property is non-null, then an additional icon div will be automatically pushed
    inside the cell's outer div with the CSS classes 'icon' and whatever other classname string
    the property referenced by 'iconKey' provides.  In addition, to help with styling, 
    the 'has-icon' class will also be added to the cell's outer div.
    
    Note that this setup lets you specify a unique icon per cell if you wish.  For example, suppose
    you have two rows:
    
      [
        SC.Object.create({
          name: 'joe',
          age: 20
          nameIcon: 'joe-face'
        }),
        SC.Object.create({
          name: 'maggie',
          age: 20
          nameIcon: 'maggie-face'
        })
      ]
    
    Then your 'name' column setup could be:
    
      SC.Object.create(SCTable.Column, {
        valueKey: 'name',
        iconKey: 'nameIcon'
      })
    
    And the cell showing Joe's name would get an icon div with classes 'icon joe-face', and the
    cell holding Maggie's name would get an icon div with classes 'icon maggie-face'.

    someone drags to resize the column in the table view as well.

  width: 100,

  /*
    Set to NO to disallow resizing this column via dragging in the table view.
    However, manually setting the 'width' property above will always work, regardless
    of the setting here.

    TableView itself will attempt to sort the column.  Be sure to pay attention to how many
    rows you're trying to sort, as this can take quite some time for large tables and raise
    "unresponsive script" errors in the browser.
