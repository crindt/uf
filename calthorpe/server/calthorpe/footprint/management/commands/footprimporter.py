        The Footprint importer (footprimporter) is used to synchronize a local system to the data of remote source. There are two import situations. The first is importing from "raw" database tables that are formatted for the UrbanFootprint beta (0.*). This is the beta schema which uses input_outputs_STUDY_AREA where the study area is the old representation of project. The second import situation is to import from a UrbanFootprint 1.* database, where the source schemas match the structure of the new. Use the -v option and specify 0 for the beta schema and 1 for the 1.* version. The default is the beta for now.
