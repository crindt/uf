UrbanFootprint
==============

UrbanFootprint is a land use planning, modeling, and data organization framework designed to facilitate more informed land use and scenario planning. UrbanFootprint is available under a GNU GPLv3 license. 

UrbanFootprint version 1.1 Alpha is built upon a suite of open source software products and includes a set of web-based scenario development and editing features. It represents customized features and software developed for initial use and alpha testing by regional planners and modelers at three of Californiaâ€™s Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) (SACOG, SANDAG, and SCAG). 

The developers of UrbanFootprint at Berkeley, California -based Calthorpe Associates, as well as the MPOs working to advance the platform, look forward to expanding the community of developers, users, and contributors to UrbanFootprint.
